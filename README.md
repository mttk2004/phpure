# PHPure

PHPure is a lightweight MVC framework inspired by Laravel, designed to help beginners learn and explore how a web application works under the MVC pattern.

## Overview

PHPure provides a clean, simple, and elegant structure to build PHP applications. It includes essential features like routing, database ORM, template engine, middleware, validation, and more, while keeping the codebase easy to understand and maintain.

This framework is perfect for:
